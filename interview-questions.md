# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props stands for properties. Props in react are arguments passed into components.

  Researched answer: Properties or 'props', are read-only components. Props are a way to pass data from one component to other components, like function arguments. Props are immutable, so they can't be modified or changed from inside the component. Props add attributes to components. These attributes are available to the component by using the key word 'this.props', which can then be utilized to render dynamic data in our render method. 



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is an interative event that takes place when a user interacts with the DOM and triggers a change within the interface.

  Researched answer:A DOM event is an interative event that takes place when a user interacts with the DOM and triggers a change within the interface.




3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:Object-oriented programming is characterized by its identification of object classes, with inherited attributes and methods.
  Functional programming attempts to avoid changing state.
  
  Researched answer:Functional Programming attempts to avoid changing state and mutable data. With functional programming, output of a function will be the same, relative to the input. A function that adds two variable will always only add two variables. In functional programming, the output of a function relies strictly on arguments. Functional programming is ideal in situations where the state and mutable data is not a factor. Functions are good with executing a particular task. Object-Oriented programming is a more complex programming paradigm  in which you program using objects to represent things (often real world objects!). These objects can be a data structure or a function itself. Also, the objects themselves hold data about them in attributes. 



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: An integer, is a whole number or number without a decimal or fraction. A float is a number, that is not whole or has a partial number, like a decimal point or fraction. 

  Researched answer:An integer, is a whole number or number without a decimal or fraction. A float is a number, that is not whole or has a partial number, like a decimal point or fraction. Utilizing floats becomes useful when calculating with precision. Like using Pi for circumference.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Ruby's returns the value of a method, on assumption, and without using a keyword.

  Researched answer: Normally with functions, if you want to return something, keyword 'return' must be used, in order to see othe output value. This is called 'explicit return'. Implicit return will return the value of a function without using a return keyword.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: Instance variable is a variable defined in a class, for which each object of the class has a separate copy.

2. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is an advanced version of SQL, that gives support to different functions of SQL. 

3. Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails, is a server-side web app framework written in Ruby.

4. ORM: Object-relational mapping, make it possible to access and manipulate objects without having to consider the change of source data.

5. Active Record: Active Record provide an interface and binding between the tables in a relational database and the Ruby program code that manipulates database records.
